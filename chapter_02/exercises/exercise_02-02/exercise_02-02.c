/* Consider the following program: 
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    printf("Parkinson's Law:\nWork expands so as to ");
    printf("fill the time\n");
    printf("available for its completion.\n");
    return 0;
}

(a) Identify the directives and statements in this program. 
DIRECTIVES:
#include <stdio.h>
STATEMENTS:
printf("Parkinson's Law:\nWork expands so as to ");
printf("fill the time\n");
printf("available for its completion.\n");
return 0;

(b) What output does the program produce? 
Parkinson's Law:
Work expands so as to fill the time
