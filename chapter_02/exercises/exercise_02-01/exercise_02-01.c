/* Exercise 2-1: Create and run Kernighan and Ritchie's famous "hello, world" program: 
int main(void)
{
    printf("hello, world\n");
}
Do you get a warning message from the compiler? If so, what's needed to make it go away? */

/* I did not get any warning messages from the compiler. */

#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    printf("hello, world\n");
